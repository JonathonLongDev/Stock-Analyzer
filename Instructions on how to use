First you must download the Stock Analysis Workbook.xlsx

Next you will download the script and change the file path inside the script to the path of the Stock Analysis Workbook.xlsx
It should look something like User/(Name)/Stock Analysis Workbook.xlsx or mini variations

Next you can create a script to auto run the script
here is the code to do that. Replace it with your filepath.
@echo off
"C:\Users\(Name of you)\Documents\Scripts\stock.py"
pause
